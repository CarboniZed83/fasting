Variable Water Fasting | Nov 12 to Feb 3 | 1968 Hours | 82 Days

It's my personal protocol for this fast.Â  It's a mainly "dirty" water fasting and allowing myself to intermittent fast on special occasions given that it's the holidays.  Also when I do intermittent fast it will be keto at the very least.

I plan to intermittent fast on:

Thanksgiving Nov-26
Brother's birthday Nov-30
Christmas Day Dec-25
New Year's Day Jan-01

So that's 4 Days out of 82 and I think that's negligible given the length of the fast.

Of course it would be "better" to simply fast all the way through but for me personally it would be more sustainable and less torturous to do it this way.

"Dirty" Water Fasting

Basically water fasting but I also intake zero calorie drinks such as Coke Zero and apple cider vinegar drinks.
